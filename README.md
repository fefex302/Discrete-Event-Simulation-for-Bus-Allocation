# Discrete-Event-Simulation-for-Bus-Allocation
A SimPy-based discrete-event simulation to model and analyze bus allocation and passenger boarding dynamics.

The code of the main simulation is in the bus_simulation directory.

The SimPy_Seminar file contains a seminar about SimPy and the presentation of the bus allocation scenario simulation.
